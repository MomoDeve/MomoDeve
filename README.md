### Hi there!

I'm Alex aka MomoDeve, a 3D Graphics & Frontend enthusiast, currently working at [Bricks](https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-bricks-inc/) as Frontend Developer.

I'm programming mostly C++ (~3 years), have some open-source projects like [MxEngine](https://github.com/asc-community/MxEngine) and [Vulkan Abstraction Layer](https://github.com/vkdev-team/VulkanAbstractionLayer). Also worked on compilers and programming language design. Sometimes help to develop other cool open-source projects, such as [AngouriMath](https://github.com/asc-community/AngouriMath) (made by my friend [WhiteBlackGoose](https://github.com/WhiteBlackGoose))

I have a personal blog where I post some cool stuff about programming, mostly game engine dev: https://momodeve.github.io. Also, if you are from Russia, you may be interested in my [Habr account](https://habr.com/ru/users/momodev/posts/), where I sometimes post programming tutorials or translate foreign articles.
