### Hi there!

I'm Alex aka MomoDeve, a game engine enthusiast, currently working at Eagle Dynamics as rendering engineer.

Programming mostly C++ (~3 years), working on open-source game engine at my free time - [MxEngine](https://github.com/asc-community/MxEngine). Also experimenting with Vulkan API here - [Vulkan Abstraction Layer](https://github.com/vkdev-team/VulkanAbstractionLayer). Before gamedev worked on compilers and programming language design. Sometimes help to develop other cool open-source projects, such as [AngouriMath](https://github.com/asc-community/AngouriMath) (made by my friend [WhiteBlackGoose](https://github.com/WhiteBlackGoose))

I have a personal blog where I post some cool stuff about programming, mostly game engine dev: https://momodeve.github.io. Also, if you are from Russia, you may be interested in my [Habr account](https://habr.com/ru/users/momodev/posts/), where I sometimes post programming tutorials or translate foreign articles.
