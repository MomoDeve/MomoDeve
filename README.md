### Hi there!

I'm Alex aka MomoDeve, a 3D Graphics & Frontend software engineer, currently working at [The Bricks](https://www.thebricks.com/) as Frontend Developer.

My professional scope is both game engine dev (C++/OpenGL/DX11/Vulkan) or Frontend (TypeScript/React). I am also maintaining open-source pet-project [MxEngine](https://github.com/asc-community/MxEngine) at my free time. Sometimes do contibutions to other cool open-source projects, such as [AngouriMath](https://github.com/asc-community/AngouriMath) (made by my friend [WhiteBlackGoose](https://github.com/WhiteBlackGoose))

I have a personal blog where I post some cool stuff about programming, mostly game engine dev: https://momodeve.github.io (currently inactive). Also, if you are from Russia, you may be interested in my [Habr account](https://habr.com/ru/users/momodev/posts/), where I sometimes post programming tutorials or translate foreign articles.
